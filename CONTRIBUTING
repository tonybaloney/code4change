-- Contributing to Code for Change --

1. Contributing to the application

Contributing to the website would be great and does not require ongoing committment to the services offered here.

2. Become a contributing developer

If you also want your services to be listed on the site, just Fork the project,
modify the services.json file with your details and the services you want to offer.

I'll merge them back in and the website will be updated.
